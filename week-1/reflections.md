# 1.1 Think About Time
Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?
The time management ideas I learned about were the "Pomodoro Technique" and the "Timebox". The productivity ideas I learned about were "The Habits of Successful People: They Have a Growth Mindset", "Creating a Habit" and "Tiny Habits".

What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?


The Pomodoro Technique is an example of "Time Boxing", which means allotting a definite amount of time within which to complete a certain task, then after the time has expired assess the progress that was made. In application, completing this reflection is applied "Time Boxing" because we should only be spending about 10 minutes on it (I set my timer for 15 minutes). Likewise, one can use "Time Boxing" (setting a fixed amount of time for a task then evaluating progress once time expires) in completing future Phase 0 assignments. In application, my timer has gone off and I've only addressed three of the questions, so I am going to reset it for another 15 minutes.

How do you manage your time currently?
I am reluctant to admit that my current time management tool is using prioritized "To Do" lists.

Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?
My current strategy is not working well in terms of time efficiency.  It seems like I get bogged down in tasks and spend way to much time on them without evaluating my progress sooner than I should be.

Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?
Yes, I going to employ the Pomodoro Technique and the creating habits technique discussed in the aforementioned videos. I'll employ the Pomodoro Technique to give myself a certain amount of time to complete a task.  Then when time expires re-evaluate my progress.  I feel like this will help accentuate the areas within which I need to devote more time or focus much more quickly than just checking off things on my "To Do" list.

What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?
I'm going to use a combination of "To Do" lists with "Time Boxing". Shortly after writing this and reviewing my post, my second 15 minute period expired. I definitely think setting a fixed amount of time for a task and evaluating my progress will increase my overall productivity. I can't believe I haven't thought or heard of this before!

# 1.2 The Command Line

What is a shell? What is "bash?"
A shell is a command like Terminal on Macs. Bash is the process that is launched when opening  the Terminal.

2. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

There were allot of commands to learn at one time and I had to space this out over 2 days. Also, some concepts were a bit abstract such as pushd, popd, and the pipes and redirection commands.  I generally get what they do, but have a hard to really understanding them.

3. Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?

Yes, for the most part I got them to all work, but sometimes not exactly as the tutorial indicated.

4. In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?

I think the most important commands and arguments to know are pwd, cd, ls, cp, find, grep and man.

5. Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

-pwd - shows you what directory you are currently in

-ls - lists the contents of the directory you are currently in

-mv - moves a file or directory

-cd - moves to file or directory

-../ - the command used along with cd to move down 1 or more directories

-touch - I forgot, went and looked back, it creates an empty file

-mkdir - makes a new directory

-less - I forgot, went and looked back, it allows you to view a file in the Terminal

-rmdir - removes a directory

-rm - I forgot, but knew it removes something, looked back, it removes a file

-help - this pulls up the different things/how to use a commands
