What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is any whole number. A float is any non-whole number.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

When you divide an integer, the output is always a whole number. So for example, if you divide 9 by 2, you get 4. When you divide a float, you will get the exact answer. So 9 divided by 2 will output 4.5. Integers are like movie tickets, half a ticket will not get you into a movie so one only looks at how many whole movie tickets one has. Meanwhile floats act like regular numbers that we are used to. They can be inexact.

Hours in a year:
```ruby
def regular_year
  x = 24 * 365
end

def leap_year
  x = 24 * 366
end
```
Minutes in a decade:
```ruby
def minutes
  x = ((24 * 60) * 365) * 10
end
```
