How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

The inspector shows you were certain elements are and their underlying code when you hover over them. This allows you to see where things are and how they are already configured.

How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

You can use the syntax such as height and width.

What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

Absolute positioning does not leave space for the element, positions the element at a specified position relative to the closest positioned ancestoror or to the containing block, and can have margins. Fixed positioning does not leave space for the element and is positioned at a specified position relatve to the screen's viewport and doesn't move it when scrolled. Static positioning is the default, is positioned according to the normal flow of the page (i.e. not positioned , and is not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties. Relative positioning lays out all elements as though the element were not positioned, and then adjusts the element's position, without changing the layout. I don't understand how these work and basically only got my project to work through trial and error. At this point, all are the most difficult. I'm having a hard time conceptualizing how these work.

What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

The border is an outter edges and surrounds the content. The margin is the space outside the border, is applied to the outside of the element, and affects how far away the element is from other elements. The padding is the space between the content, is applied to the inside of the element, and affects how far your element's content is away from the border.

What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

It was difficult and at points very frustrating. Allot of trial and error. Not sure how much information I actually retained, but it was challenging so overall I enjoyed it.
