What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

The purpose of the site will be to show potential employers what I've accomplished by attending Dev Bootcamp. The content will most likely include my work history, background, passions, past projects and links to current projects.

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience's interests probably include learning a bit about me and what I can do as a full stack developer. The site will be a "show me what you can/have done" portfolio.

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
