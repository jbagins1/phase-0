<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was fun creating the website, troubleshooting, and using the skills we've been learning.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It was exciting because what I found was that I would try something out, then it wouldn't look right on the website. Then I would research the answer and trouble shoot until I got it working. After that I ran the code through the validation tool and at its peek my code had 20 errors. Then I would read the description of the error and research its resolution.  Sometimes I would research a resolution and more error would appear, which required reading the errors carefully and conducting more research on how to fix them.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I tried to keep it simple.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
A good thing about HTML seems to be that it is that some of the semantics are intuitive, such as when you want to put an image into a website, the tag is <img>, but within that you also have to denote a source, represented by src="[insert file path]". This seems easy to understand for beginngers. A bad thing is that certain browsers may not support, for example, HTML5.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Many of the semantics involve words with removed vowels, which makes remembering the semantics easier.
